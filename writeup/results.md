There are a number of available models for converting IUCN Red List status to 
extinction likelihoods for species. These include the IUCN 100 year scenario, 
500 year scenario and the Pessimistic scenario of ______. Having alternative 
models for converting conservation status to extinction likelihoods allows us
to test the robustness of the prioritisation score to the assumptions of the 
model. To do this, we compare which species are prioritised by each model, and
hopefully they will be similar.

Another test of robustness we can do is to perturbations of our phylogenetic 
trees, as we know that the tree of life is not settled and there is not 
consensus on a single tree within an order. One way to do this is to calculate 
the scores for a large number of possible trees and average the results. 
Another possible method is to generate random phylogenetic trees,
